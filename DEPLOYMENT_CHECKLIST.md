### Next Steps for Vercel Deployment:

1. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Import project from GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings (already in `vercel.json`)

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name
   DB_DIALECT=postgres
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=4000
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.vercel.app
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
   EMAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_TO=your_email@gmail.com
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-for-production
   GRAPHQL_INTROSPECTION=false
   GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND=false
   ```

3. **Update Production URLs:**
   - Replace `https://your-domain.vercel.app` with actual Vercel domain
   - Update `VITE_GRAPHQL_URI` and `VITE_API_URL` in client environment

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Set up PostgreSQL database (recommended: Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Railway)
   - Run migration script on production database

5. **Deploy:**
   - Push to main branch or deploy via Vercel dashboard
   - Monitor deployment logs for any issues

## ðŸ“‹ Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test GraphQL API endpoints
- [ ] Test contact form functionality
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test navigation and routing
- [ ] Verify project data displays correctly

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Database Connection:** Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted
2. **CORS Errors:** Verify CORS_ORIGIN matches your Vercel domain
3. **Email Issues:** Configure Gmail app password for contact form
4. **Build Failures:** Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
